      <h2>ü§î Why do we do this?</h2>
      <p>
        5 people thought that "hacking" the Agbar tower (Olivia, Paola, Pilar,
        Tiago & Jepser), might be really cool.
      </p>
      <p>
        We wanted people to share a message with Barcelona, so why not something
        that makes makes them feel part of it.
      </p>
      <p>That's how we created this...</p>
      <h2>ü§∑‚Äç‚ôÄÔ∏è How does it work?</h2>
      <p>
        You have a list of emotions that you can share with others, the most
        voted is the one shown in the tower as a cool projection!
      </p>
      <p>
        Every 10 minutes we reset the counters and you can vote again, make it
        count and share it with your friends.
